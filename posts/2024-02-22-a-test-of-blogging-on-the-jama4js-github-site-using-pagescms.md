title: A Test of Blogging on the JAMA4JS GitHub site using PagesCMS
---
Trying to write a blog after working with the PagesCMS.

Somewhat difficult to figure out what it was actually doing.

Seems like it would be better if it suggested common categories immediately and asked you if you wanted to suggest a name and then created them.

Once I actually figured out what the example was doing, then it wasn't that bad.

Still working through the media and site settings, so those may still be an issue (lacking much in the way of autocreation)
